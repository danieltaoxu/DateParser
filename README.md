JAVA Parser for date

sbt as a build tool
sur/main/java for the principal class
sur/main/test for junit
sur/main/resources for some properties or sth else against hard code like file path in windows or mac or linux

for test, just change a file path in config.properties and compile and run in IDE or terminal
